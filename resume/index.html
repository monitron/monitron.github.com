            <li><strong>Headed design and front-end development of a core data analysis product.</strong> Built as a configurable, pluggable, internationalized single-page web app, this tool opened new areas of business for the company by enabling non-technical users to perform ad-hoc query and analysis over large and complex data sets. It consistently allowed users to produce novel, actionable insights at the multiple high-profile organizations where it was deployed.</li>
            <li><strong>Designed and built novel interactive visualizations to allow human-scale views of huge data sets.</strong> These visualizations brought trends, outliers and suspicious activity into focus, helping users understand their data in ways they hadn't thought possible. 
            <li><strong>Designed and rapidly prototyped critical web applications for an international broadcasting company.</strong> Created adaptive interfaces that let advanced users and busy executives alike access tailored information and take action without getting in their way or wasting their time.</li>
            <li>Iterated in a tight loop with end users to build interfaces that truly served their needs, while balancing individual customer use cases with the product's applicability to a wider audience.</li>
            <li>Addressed complex security interface problems in an environment requiring absolute trust.</li>
            <li>Contributed quality code across a spectrum of codebases from back-end Java and Ruby to front-end TypeScript with React/Redux.</li>
