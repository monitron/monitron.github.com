title: "Clojure: Concatenate Sequences"
published: true

<p>Clojure makes me feel clever. It also probably already has a way to concatenate an arbitrary number of seqs, but I haven't gotten there so I wrote it myself anyway:</p>

<p>I'd love for an experienced Lispite or Clojurian to tell me what I could do better.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong>&nbsp;I already found a better way, now that I just learned that <em>conj</em> takes multiple element arguments:</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/275404.js"></script></p>
<p><strong>Edit again:&nbsp;</strong>And one page later in the book, I have learned about <em>into</em>:</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/275429.js"></script></p>
<p>Neat. Eerily readable, too. Can it get any more concise than this?</p>
<p><strong>Final edit:</strong></p>
<p>Yup, I found <em>concat</em>. And here this silly story ends.</p>
