<p><span>I am such a sucker.<br/><br/><img align="right" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lrkm1cuiXP1qiukc7.jpg"/>You see, there&#8217;s a new phone coming out soon. It seems to be called the <em>Google Nexus Prime</em>, the <em>Verizon Droid Prime</em>, or really no one has any idea. It might run the new version of Android (&#8220;Ice Cream Sandwich&#8221;) or it might not. Ice Cream Sandwich is probably great, but it could also be a horrendously buggy deathtrap set just for early adopters like me. The phone probably has a big, high resolution screen, more memory and a faster processor, but no one really knows. The only really important thing about it (maybe) is that it might be a <strong>Google Experience Device</strong>, which means that it provides the best possible Android user experience, except when it doesn&#8217;t, and Google promises to provide timely updates for it, but sometimes they don&#8217;t.<br/><br/>I want this thing so badly, even though I and the rest of the Internet have no real idea what it is. I have a Google Alert so I can read the latest totally made up rumors about it. I have taken the time to compare the likely release dates with the exact moment I become eligible for a phone upgrade. I&#8217;ve already started looking at my current phone &ndash; state of the art only a year ago &ndash; as a clunky, bumbling, unreliable monster that might as well be powered by steam.<br/><br/>In short, and to reiterate, I am <em>such</em> a sucker.</span></p>
