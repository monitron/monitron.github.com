title: Funny But Not Nice
---

<p>On this Mother&#8217;s Day, I&#8217;d like to thank my mom for a small piece of genius she employed in raising me. This has nothing to do with band-aids, macaroni and cheese or any of the other daily gifts normally associated with having a mother. It concerns these words:&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s funny but not nice.&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I have clear memories of my mother saying this to me, usually through laughter or at least with a wide smile. It meant that we&#8217;d just shared something in the course of talking that might have been hilarious, but that perhaps it shouldn&#8217;t leave the dinner table. Or the car. Or wherever we were having one of our great conversations. Maybe it was a lighthearted joke at someone else&#8217;s expense, perhaps it was a little dark, or likely it was just would have seemed strange coming out of the average eight-year-old&#8217;s mouth.</p>

<p>Regardless, it was genius because it allowed us to share in the inevitable things that make one&nbsp;giggle while feeling a little guilty as well. It made me feel like an adult for a moment, but thanks to the &#8220;FBNN&#8221; explanation I knew not to take the joke too seriously or share it in mixed company.</p>

<p>As an adult, I find that the concept of Funny But Not Nice comes in handy a lot. Maybe I&#8217;m crazy, but I feel like the culture my kids are bathing in is increasingly snark-based. Have you watched TV lately? It&#8217;s not so much &#8220;funny but not nice&#8221; but rather &#8220;cacklingly hilarious and let&#8217;s kick &#8216;em when they&#8217;re down.&#8221; I would love it if my kids grew up thinking that they had more to contribute than just throwing back their heads to laugh at the expense of others.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;d be a hypocrite if I said there wasn&#8217;t humor to be had in Funny But Not Nice; it just doesn&#8217;t have to define you. As with most things, a balance can be struck&#8230;and that is what my mom did for me.&nbsp;Thanks, mom. :)</p>
