title: You Need Professional Help
---

<p>You!&nbsp;Do you have a mediocre doctor?</p>

<p>Are you letting your primary doctor care for a specialized condition?</p>

<p>Do you really need medical help, but you are too scared/lazy/discouraged to actually make an appointment?</p>

<p>The life lesson I&#8217;ve learned today: Go. Now. See a doctor. A <strong>good</strong>&nbsp;one. Likely a&nbsp;specialist.</p>

<p>A few years ago I was diagnosed with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashimoto's_thyroiditis">Hashimoto&#8217;s Thyroiditis</a>, a disease in which my immune system delivers a series of devastating roundhouse kicks to my thyroid gland, gradually transforming it into a puffy, functionless blob. The effect is permanent; eventually my thyroid will no longer produce any hormones at all. I could lose my memory, go nuts, start to look like the unfortunate person at right or even die. Though I&#8217;m not to that stage yet, hypothyroidism is already making me fat, tired, moody and packed with cholesterol. You can see why it should have been my highest priority to get treatment.</p>



<p>Yet it took me a year to get off of my formidable ass and do something about it. Why?</p>

<p>When my primary doctor diagnosed me with hypothyroidism, he put me on a course of medication which had little if any effect on my symptoms. After follow-up blood tests, I was told that I was now normal and that no adjustment was needed. So I got discouraged, and when my refills ran out, I just stopped taking the meds. A profoundly dumb decision, I know, but I&#8217;d love to blame it on the depression that often goes along with hypothyroidism. No? That doesn&#8217;t fly? Fine.. I&#8217;m just an idiot. :)</p>



<p>Today, thanks in part to nudgings provided by my mom and my girlfriend, I finally made it back into a doctor&#8217;s office for another round. This time I was visiting a bona fide endocrinologist with impressive credentials and ample experience with my condition. Here are some things that pleased and/or stunned me about the experience:</p>

<ul><li>I met the doctor in an actual office, at an actual desk in a room with no needles, tongue depressors or cotton balls of any description.</li>

<li>The doctor spent a long time asking questions and explaining my diagnosis, in detail and without patronizing me.</li>

<li>When tests were needed, a phlebotomist was on-site to draw my blood, saving me a trip to one of my least favorite places. She was an awesome phlebotomist, too. I like writing &#8220;phlebotomist.&#8221;</li>

<li>I was given an extremely generous supply of samples of my new drug, lasting me all the way until my first follow-up appointment!</li>

<li>Upon checking out, the friendly office staff gave me a URL and credentials allowing me&nbsp;to access my lab results and request refills online. I have a hard time describing how awesome this is for me.</li>

</ul><p>Basically, I was told that while my PCP had gotten my diagnosis right, he&#8217;d botched my dosage and missed signs that the medication wasn&#8217;t helping enough. Apparently the generic drug I&#8217;d been taking was not reliably effective, and it was clear that I needed a higher dose even before test results came back.</p>

<p>It was wonderful to leave the office feeling like I finally knew what was going on and had the tools to fix it; I took my first <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0000684/">Synthroid</a> dose before I left the parking lot. Best of all, I feel like I&#8217;m in good hands.</p>

<p>From just my friends and family&#8217;s lives, I can think of many instances where people have gone without medical treatment, or slogged along with mediocre care, because of fear, discouragement, procrastination or simply not knowing that better options existed. I can count myself among the members of this sorry clan, but I don&#8217;t want to do it anymore. Feeling like I&#8217;m on the road to health feels much better.</p>

<p>Your turn now!</p>
