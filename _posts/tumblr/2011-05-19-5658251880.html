title: RailsConf: OMG, You Missed It
---

<p>This week I attended my first <a href="http://www.railsconf.com/">RailsConf</a>&nbsp;(thanks to <a href="http://taximagic.com/">my awesome employer</a>), and it was amazing. For my nontechnical readers, if any, <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> is a lovely framework for building web applications and RailsConf is an annual gathering of its developer community. They meet to learn, <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html">hack</a>, network and bask in the glow of the heroes who have made Rails possible.</p>

<p>I learned a few things at the conference which I&#8217;d like to share with you:</p>

<ol><li><strong>Rails people are a lot of fun.</strong> If I may be allowed to stereotype, they&#8217;re very friendly and many of them love beer. While they&#8217;re undoubtably geeks, they have unfamiliar attributes like extroversion, athleticism and fashionable hairstyles. As a dead standard hacker &mdash; shy, unkempt and overweight &mdash; I actually stand out unfavorably in the Rails crowd.</li>

<li><strong>Rails folks are opinionated in the best possible way.</strong> I&#8217;ve heard the Rails crowd slandered as a Kool-Aid-drinking hive mind, but this couldn&#8217;t be further from the truth; they&#8217;re not afraid to disagree with each other and even with the anointed leaders of the community. Better still, this often takes the form of passionate but respectful debate. Amazing.</li>

<li>If you only go to events where you aren&#8217;t in danger of seeing a man <strong>strip his pants off onstage and dance</strong> the &#8220;Double Dream Hands&#8221; with an ensemble cast of Ruby and Rails core developers (before noon, no less) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWOAHIpmLAI?t=41:00">you should probably avoid RailsConf</a>.</li>

<li>In a pinch, mononymous singer <strong>Ke$ha</strong> can serve as a semi-valid metaphor for a programming language.</li>

<li>It is <strong>not</strong>&nbsp;recommended to <strong>get horribly sick</strong> halfway through the conference and to consequently have to bail on an afternoon of exciting talks and an evening of homegrown music and social interaction. Trust me, I&#8217;ve tried it and it is no fun.</li>

<li>The Rails elders are just as confused as I am about what to do with the <strong>mound of JavaScript</strong> under which they are recently buried. They do have some great ideas, though.</li>

<li>Using an informal sample of everyone I met this week, studies show that <strong>every human</strong> owns a MacBook Air, an iPhone 4 and an iPad 2. They all use Google Chrome and vim. Also, everyone has a Twitter account and human communication happens primarily through hashtags.</li>

<li>If you&#8217;re a Rails developer, you need to go to this conference. But be warned that, upon your return, you&#8217;ll want to <strong>delete every piece of code you&#8217;ve ever written</strong> and start from scratch with all the cool new tools and techniques you&#8217;ve absorbed.</li>

</ol><p>Interestingly enough, some of the best ideas I&#8217;ve taken from RailsConf have nothing to do with Rails. One is that there&#8217;s a host of other web technology (e.g. <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>) that I can&#8217;t wait to play with. Another is that I really, really want to become a more active participant in the Open Source world. A third is that I need to meet more geeks and make a serious effort to hang out with them.</p>

<p>Hopefully I can find some time to do these things, rather than simply adding them to my long list of things to feel bad about <em>not</em>&nbsp;doing.</p>
