title: Hello from San Antonio
---

<p>I don&#8217;t use Opera. I&#8217;m not on Windows XP. And I&#8217;ve definitely never been to San Antonio, Texas. So Facebook is right in calling this access &#8220;suspicious.&#8221;</p>

<p>The infuriating part of this is that it&#8217;s the third time it&#8217;s happened in the past few months. Each time, I&#8217;ve been changing my password to a string of 20 random letters and numbers, like so:</p>

<p>So&#8230;how is this happening? I don&#8217;t give out my Facebook password willy-nilly; I only enter it into facebook.com and the official Facebook app on my phone. It&#8217;s unnerving and inconvenient to lose access to an apparent intrusion, repeatedly. Facebook, I shake my fist in your general direction.</p>

<p>In other news, this week is <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2011">RailsConf</a> for me, which so far can best be described as &#8220;5,000 nerds with MacBooks.&#8221; One thing&#8217;s for sure: I won&#8217;t be standing out from the crowd much.</p>
